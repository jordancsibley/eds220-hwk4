# Remote Sensing Analysis of the Thomas Fire 
### Environmental Data Science 220 Fall 2024 - Homework #4

## Description 
This course assignment aims to explore the area impacted by the Thomas Fire across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in December 2017. Using remote sensing data to create false color images, the extent of the fire scars is mapped and visualized. 

## Repository Structure 
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that were used to visualize the fire perimeter and create the false color image.

## Data Access 
This project required two datasets to provide the remote sensing data and fire perimeter data. 

- Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data, retrieved from the Microsoft Planetary Computer [data catalogue](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2)
- Historical Fire Perimeters dataset that comes from The Fire and Resource Assessment Program presented by [Cal Fire](https://www.fire.ca.gov/what-we-do/fire-resource-assessment-program/fire-perimeters).
